Pharmacy Management System 💊🩺
I’m excited to share my Pharmacy Management System project! Built using Python and MySQL, this app streamlines pharmacy operations with features like:
User authentication (login/signup with password recovery)
Medicine management (add, update, delete, search)
Real-time database integration for seamless data handling

With a focus on security and usability, this system simplifies tasks like inventory management and updating medicine details with over 11 fields.
This project allowed me to refine my skills in full-stack development, MySQL, and building user-friendly Tkinter interfaces.
